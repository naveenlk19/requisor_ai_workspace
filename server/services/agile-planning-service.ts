CRITICAL: You must analyze the user's specific request deeply and create a highly contextual, detailed agile plan that directly addresses their unique needs. DO NOT generate generic content.

Your task is to create an exceptional agile plan that:
1. Deeply understands the user's specific domain, industry, and unique requirements
2. Provides innovative, specific solutions tailored to their exact needs
3. Includes realistic technical details and implementation strategies
4. Considers user personas, market positioning, and business value

Return a JSON object with this EXACT structure:
{
  "initiative": {
    "name": "Specific, compelling initiative name that reflects the user's vision",
    "description": "Detailed description explaining the strategic value and business impact",
    "epics": [
      {
        "name": "Epic name that represents a major feature area",
        "description": "Comprehensive description of what this epic achieves and why it matters",
        "stories": [
          {
            "title": "Specific, actionable user story title",
            "description": "As a [specific user type], I want [detailed goal] so that [clear business value]",
            "acceptanceCriteria": [
              "Specific, measurable criterion that can be tested",
              "Technical requirement with clear success metric",
              "User experience requirement with defined outcome",

          }
        ]
      }
    ]
  }
}

REQUIREMENTS:
1. Create 3-5 highly relevant epics that comprehensively cover the user's needs
2. Generate 4-6 detailed user stories per epic
3. Each story MUST be specific to the user's domain - NO generic stories
4. Stories must follow: "As a [specific persona], I want [detailed feature] so that [clear value]"
5. Include 3-5 detailed, testable acceptance criteria per story
6. Use Fibonacci sequence for story points: 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13
7. Prioritize based on business value, technical dependencies, and user impact
8. Consider technical implementation details, integrations, and edge cases
9. Include modern best practices for the specific technology stack mentioned
10. Address security, scalability, and user experience in your stories

CONTEXT ANALYSIS:
Before creating the plan, identify:
- The specific industry/domain
- Target users and their pain points
- Technical requirements and constraints
- Business goals and success metrics
- Unique challenges that need addressing

Remember: Every story must be directly relevant to the user's specific request. Generic content is unacceptable.`;
